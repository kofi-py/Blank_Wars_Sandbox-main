⏺ I've read the entire file (both parts). This is a transcript from your
  previous Claude Code session on November 12, 2025, where you worked
  through several challenging issues with the rubber duck river race game.

  Key issues from that session:

  1. Race restart problem: The game would freeze after clicking "Race Again"
   - eventually solved by simply reloading the page instead of manually
  resetting everything
  2. Score calculation: Fixed an issue where the score was just 10× distance
   instead of using the composite formula (placement + health + time
  bonuses)
  3. Level 2 conflicts: The previous agent had added Level 2 (cave) code
  that was causing problems with the finish line and restart
  4. Duck customization: Changed all ducks to yellow, then made competitors
  orange, reduced from 100 → 50 → 10 ducks, and added unique colors
  5. UI cleanup: Removed race number flags and the duck number input box

  The session ended with you trying to make the 10 ducks have unique colors
  and be more competitive, but encountering issues where they all appeared
  the same color and weren't competitive enough.

  What would you like me to help with regarding this project?

> can you pick up from exactly where we left off 

⏺ I'll pick up exactly where you left off. You were trying to get 10 ducks
  with unique colors and make them more competitive, but they all appeared
  the same color and weren't keeping up. The previous agent had identified
  the color assignment issue and proposed a fix.

  Let me read the current state and apply the fixes:

⏺ Read(rubber-duck-river-race/game.js)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines

⏺ Now let me fix the color assignment to be sequential (so each duck gets a
  unique color):

⏺ Update(rubber-duck-river-race/game.js)

       1283            const row = Math.floor(i / ducksPerRow);
       1284            const col = i % ducksPerRow;
       1285    
       1286 -          // Random color
       1287 -          const color = DUCK_COLORS[Math.floor(Math.random()
            -   * DUCK_COLORS.length)];
       1286 +          // Assign unique color to each duck (sequentially)
       1287 +          const color = DUCK_COLORS[i % DUCK_COLORS.length];
       1288    
       1289            // Sequential race number from shuffled array 
              (1-150)
       1290            const raceNumber = raceNumbers[i];

⏺ Now let me check the AI speed settings to see why they're not competitive:

⏺ Read(rubber-duck-river-race/game.js)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines

⏺ The AI speeds look good on paper. Let me check if the AI movement code is
  actually working properly:

⏺ Let me check how the player movement compares to see if the multipliers
  are balanced:

⏺ Read(rubber-duck-river-race/game.js)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines

⏺ I found the issue! The AI ducks and player use different movement systems.
   The AI movement multiplier (80) is too low. Let me increase it
  significantly to make them competitive:

       1359                duck.userData.currentSpeed = 
              duck.userData.baseSpeed * (0.95 + Math.random() * 0.1);
       1360            }
       1361    
       1362 -          // Move duck forward at current speed (same scale 
            - as player)
       1363 -          duck.userData.distance += 
            - duck.userData.currentSpeed * deltaTime * 80; // Adjusted 
            - multiplier for competitive balance
       1362 +          // Move duck forward at current speed (increased 
            + multiplier for competitive racing)
       1363 +          duck.userData.distance += 
            + duck.userData.currentSpeed * deltaTime * 180; // Higher 
            + multiplier so elite ducks can keep up
       1364    
       1365            // AI Steering logic - Elite tiers make faster, 
              smarter decisions
       1366            let steerInterval;

> that looks like a very very extreme jump 80x to 180x??? what about 100? 

⏺ You're absolutely right - 80 to 180 is way too extreme! Let's try 100 as a
   more reasonable increase:

⏺ Update(rubber-duck-river-race/game.js)
  ⎿  Updated rubber-duck-river-race/game.js with 2 additions and 2 removals
       1359                duck.userData.currentSpeed = 
              duck.userData.baseSpeed * (0.95 + Math.random() * 0.1);
       1360            }
       1361    
       1362 -          // Move duck forward at current speed (same scale 
            -  as player)
       1363 -          duck.userData.distance += 
            -  duck.userData.currentSpeed * deltaTime * 80; // Adjusted 
            -  multiplier for competitive balance
       1362 +          // Move duck forward at current speed (increased 
            +  multiplier for competitive racing)
       1363 +          duck.userData.distance += 
            +  duck.userData.currentSpeed * deltaTime * 100; // Increased
            +   from 80 to make ducks more competitive
       1364    
       1365            // AI Steering logic - Elite tiers make faster, 
              smarter decisions
       1366            let steerInterval;

⏺ Good call! Changed from 80 to 100 - a 25% increase instead of 125%. This
  should make the AI ducks noticeably more competitive without being crazy
  fast.

  Hard refresh localhost:8000 (Cmd+Shift+R) to test:
  1. Each duck should now have a unique color
  2. The AI ducks should keep up better with you

  Let me know how they perform and we can adjust from there!

⏺ Now let me boost just 2 specific ducks. I'll make the first duck (red) 10%
   faster and the second duck (orange) 5% faster:

⏺ Done! Reverted the global change and now:
  - Duck #0 (red) is 10% faster (speedMultiplier 88 vs 80)
  - Duck #1 (orange) is 5% faster (speedMultiplier 84 vs 80)
  - All other 8 ducks remain at normal speed (80)

  Hard refresh localhost:8000 (Cmd+Shift+R) to test. You should see the red
  duck and orange duck keeping up better than the rest!

 fastest one 2% faster, could you also have them do more jumps and evasive 
maneauvers over the obstacles? 

⏺ Looking at the screenshot, I see the ducks are still showing as
  orange/yellow shades, not the pastels. Let me check the
  createCompetitorDuck function to see if it's actually using the color
  parameter:

⏺ I see the issue! The 3D model is using color.setHex() which should work,
  but the model's texture might be overriding it. Let me make the colors
  more prominent and also fix the speed/jump issues:

⏺ Perfect! I've made all the changes:

  Colors:
  - Added emissive lighting to make the pastel colors more visible (they
  should glow slightly now)

  Speed boosts:
  - Duck #0 (light pink): Now 13% faster total (91 multiplier, was 88)
  - Duck #1 (peach): Now 7% faster total (86 multiplier, was 84)

  Jumps & Evasion:
  - Increased jump detection distances by 37-50% across all skill levels
  - Increased jump detection width from 3 to 4 units
  - Nearly doubled steering frequency (ultra-elite now steer every 8 frames
  instead of 15)
  - Made all ducks steer more aggressively (50% more left/right movement,
  less straight)

  Hard refresh localhost:8000 (Cmd+Shift+R) to test! The ducks should now:
  - Show pastel colors more clearly
  - Jump much more often
  - Dodge obstacles more aggressively
  - The top 2 ducks should be faster and more competitive

> i take it back lol, the top duck was impossibly fast. there was no 
possible way for me to catch up, you have to dial it a bit, also the pastel 
is not working, they look like ghosts, just do various light colors like 
powder blue, light teal, sand, peach, blush pink, cream, light beige, sky 
blue, apricot, rosewater 

⏺ Let me fix both issues - dial back the speed and use better light colors
  without the ghost effect:

  Colors:
  - Removed the ghost-like emissive glow
  - Changed to your specified colors: powder blue, light teal, sand, peach,
  blush pink, cream, light beige, sky blue, apricot, rosewater

  Speed:
  - Duck #0 (powder blue): Now just 5% faster (84 vs 80)
  - Duck #1 (light teal): Now just 3% faster (82.4 vs 80)

  Much more reasonable! Hard refresh localhost:8000 (Cmd+Shift+R) to test.
  The ducks should now look better (not ghostly) and the top duck should be
  competitive but catchable.

> strange but now they're all shades of like red and orange again like they 
were before the last change. there's like no blue for sure

   other light colors instead of red/orange!
